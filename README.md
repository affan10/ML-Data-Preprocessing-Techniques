# ML-Data-Preprocessing-Techniques
This repository contains a tabular dataset on which I applied some standard preprocessing techniques. The result was a final, cleansed dataset that can be fed to different predictive algorithms.

Most of the code is taken from Machine Learning Mastery by Jason Brownlee and some from towardsdatascience.com.
